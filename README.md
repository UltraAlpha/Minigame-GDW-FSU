TITLE: Red Light District

In the Red Light District, what makes someone a criminal?

Getting caught.

Red Light District is a simple 2d endless platformer where you play as a ninja… amongus… thing called “The Thief”, collecting floating white coins that scroll across a green background. There are no enemies to worry about; instead, it’s the background itself that you have to watch out for. Background props will scroll across the level while the light is green. When the light is yellow, you have anywhere from two to five seconds to get behind one of those props before the light turns red. If the light is red, and you aren’t behind a prop, your thief is caught, and you lose!

CONTROLS:

Left / Right arrow keys OR A / D: Move left or right

Space bar: Jump

Down arrow key / S: Act natural. When pressed while standing on a platform, The Thief will drop through the platform. When held while standing on the ground, The Thief will stick to whichever platform they are currently touching, allowing for easier hiding when the background turns red.

This game is still in development; I don't know how to make a UI to show coin counts (which are already a public int viewable in The Thief's inspector) and I don't know how to tell the game to check if The Thief is actually hiding behind a block when the screen turns red. So, this is less of a "game" and more of a "proof of concept" demo. As a result, getting "caught" by the eye doesn't do anything, and while there is a coin counting variable in Unity for this game, there is no UI feature to show that variable in-game. There is no way to "lose" the game in its current state, but have fun anyway!

The game as it is right now was co-developed by me and karyotype96 on Github, as I needed help with animations and scene transition logic, and to organize my scripts better. We will most likely continue to work on this little game in the future; I have a lot of additions planned! Eventually, we hope to monetize this game on Steam!

All assets were custom-made by James Mahoney.
Sprites were made in Aseprite.
Soundtrack was made in Beepbox (not implemented)
